I wanted to start a blog a long time ago! I hope to make this interesting to read, in the very least for myself. I plan on writing about technology and concepts that interest me, and use this blog as a sort of "learning diary" to help me keep track of my progress as a full-stack developer. I'm really surprised at how much I've learned in a relatively short amount of time but It seems the more I learn, the more I know I don't know! So heres to continued learning and curiosity
